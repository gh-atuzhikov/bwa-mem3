 * The recovered 8-bit kernel `smithWaterman128_8` (and the AVX2/AVX-512 ports)
 * runs an UNSIGNED [0,255] score recurrence and is byte-exact for long reads
 * ONLY inside the envelope below. The decisive constraint is that the per-lane
 * score re-baselining must NEVER fire for an admitted pair: its saturating
 * subtract is not generally lossless (it can zero a still-positive off-diagonal
 * cell, which the recurrence then misreads as the h00==0 local-restart sentinel
 * and truncates a valid alignment — z-drop is a row-level early-exit, not a
 * per-cell guarantee). Held inert, the kernel is a plain exact unsigned SW.
 *
 *   - len1, len2 < MAX_SEQ_LEN8  : slab width + the wide per-row position
 *     side channel are sized MAX_SEQ_LEN8; rows/cols at or beyond it would
 *     run off the slab.
 *   - len1 >= len2 (target >= query) : the gscore (query-end) capture is
 *     byte-identical to scalar only when the query-end column lies on/left of
 *     the main diagonal. See smithWaterman128_8 gscore capture.
 *   - w <= BSW8_MAX_W (= 127)     : every band/position quantity is encoded
 *     as a diagonal offset d = j - i in [-w, +w], which fits signed int8
 *     only for w <= 127. The default opt->w = 100 qualifies; wide-band
 *     retries (w doubling to 200/400/800) do NOT and fall back to 16-bit.
 *   - zdrop + maxStep <= 253      : zdrop is broadcast into the DP as a byte
 *     (_mm256_set1_epi8), so it must fit one, and the maxStep headroom keeps the
 *     z-drop comparison from wrapping at the top of the range. The DP body AND
 *     the h0-prefix column/row seed (smithWaterman*_8 setup) are both unsigned-
 *     saturating [0,255], and the seed is the raw h0 clamped to uint8 (the old
 *     min(h0, zdrop+1) prefix clamp went away with the re-baseline floor).
 *     maxStep is the largest per-step score increment,
 *     max(w_match, w_ambig, 1) = max(opt->a, 1).
 *   - h0 + min(len1,len2)*a < 255 - maxStep : the MAX ATTAINABLE score (seed
 *     plus an all-match diagonal over the shorter sequence) stays below the byte
 *     ceiling, so no row max can ever reach it. This is also what bounds h0
 *     itself, which is why there is no separate h0 gate: the former
 *     h0 <= zdrop + 1 condition existed to zero the removed re-baseline floor
 *     and was dropped in EXT-4 (see bsw8_envelope_ok below).
 *
 * NOTE: minval (= h0 + min(len)*a) is still used by sortPairsLenExt as the
 * counting-sort bin index (hist[minval]) and must stay < MAX_SEQ_LEN8 there for
 * the bin to be in range; that is a histogram-sizing constraint, NOT the tier
 * decision. Pairs failing this envelope fall through to the existing 16-bit

                                          the re-baseline era, where it also kept

 * query coordinates cb/ce, and write their results into caller-owned arrays:
 *   first[t]  first shadowing chain of sorted-chain t, or -1 (init by caller)
 *   kept[t]   0/2/3 kept-class of sorted-chain t (init 0 by caller)
 *   *surv     survivor list, in scan (weight-descending) order
 * Nothing in `a` is mutated, so the two runs are independent. All indices are
 * into the post-ks_introsort array `a`.
 *
 * The reference is compiled only for the opt-in cross-check build (see the

 *       significant overlap is no heavier than that one, so if that first overlap did
 *       not dominate i, nothing later can either: the break can only fire at the first
 *       significant overlap (handled in phase 1) or never. i then survives.

/* D3 (--meth, PR-3): remap one seed hit from SEED-index (f/r-doubled) coordinates
 * to ORIGINAL-reference coordinates + a bisulfite hypothesis label.
 *
 * The seed reference has 2N contigs in r0,f0,r1,f1,... order (rchrK = G→A / OB,
 * fchrK = C→T / OT); both are FORWARD projections of the original contig K, so
 * the seed-local position equals the original-local position. The seed FM-index
 * additionally doubles its own pac (forward + reverse-complement), so a seed hit
 * `seed_rbeg` lives in [0, 2*L_seed) where >= L_seed means the hit is on the RC
 * of the seed reference. That RC strand is the genomic alignment strand and is
 * INDEPENDENT of the OT/OB hypothesis (which is the f/r contig parity).
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   seed_bns   — the seed (f/r-doubled) BNS, used to decode seed_rbeg.
 *   orig_bns   — the original BNS (N contigs), the remap target.
 *   seed_rbeg  — seed-index doubled-pac coordinate of the seed start.
 *   seed_len   — seed length (>0); used to project the start across strands.
 * Outputs (only written on success):
 *   *orig_rbeg   — start coordinate in ORIGINAL doubled-pac space [0, 2*L_orig).
 *   *orig_rid    — original contig id.
 *   *hypothesis  — 1 = OT (odd "f" seed contig), 0 = OB (even "r" seed contig).
 * Returns 0 on success, -1 if the hit cannot be remapped (bridging / out of
 * range), in which case the caller should drop the seed.
 *
 * NOTE: the reverse-strand re-encoding below is the single most placement-
 * critical step in --meth (spec §5.2 / plan §5: "strand bookkeeping can silently
 * corrupt placement"). It is exercised end-to-end and covered by the seed→
 * original remap + OT/OB PE/strand placement regression tests
 * (test/regression/meth_seed_index.sh and the live mem --meth placement tests).

     *   - `genomic` frees only the conversion direction, so a real variant in the
     *     opposite direction stays a mismatch and remains visible.
     *   - `collapsed` frees the mirror cell too, so C/T (and G/A) are fully

//                        and uses sp.score/qle/gscore/gtle directly.
//
//   FP_STATUS_TIGHT    — fast-path fails (too many mismatches) but the
//                        ungapped score bounds the useful SW band:
//                          tight_band = ceil((min(len1,len2)·a - ungapped_score)

//                        Caller runs SW with this tight band instead of
//                        opt->w, and skips MAX_BAND_TRY retries (the
//                        bound is an upper bound on any gapped score).
//
//   FP_STATUS_FALLBACK — ambig base or out-of-range length. Caller uses
//                        opt->w with the full retry loop.
//
// Derivation of tight_band: for any alignment with band offset B from
// diagonal, min B gaps are required; cost ≥ B · (o_min + e_min). Max
// alignment score (all matches) ≤ min(len1, len2) · a. For any gapped
// alignment to beat the observed ungapped max score S:
//   min_len·a - B·(o_min+e_min) > S
//   B < (min_len·a - S) / (o_min + e_min)
// So any band ≥ tight_band is sufficient; narrower bands suffice too
// when the gapped alternative score is < min_len·a. Starting SW at
// tight_band is strictly correct and avoids over-banded DP work.

    //                    27, MAPQ in none. The fast path emits e.g. 151M and
    //                    148M3S where the DP finds 138M1D13M and 148M1D3M.
